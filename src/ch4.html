<h2>A. The Selection of Patients</h2>

<p>
	Everyone who is sent to you is a patient of yours. This does
	not mean that you select him, nor that you choose the kind of
	‘treatment’ that is suitable. But it does mean that noöne comes to
	you by mistake. There are no errors in Godʹs plan. It would be an
	error, however, to assume that you know what to offer everyone
	who comes. This is not up to you to decide. There is a tendency to
	assume that you are being called on constantly to make sacrifices of
	yourself for those who come. This could hardly be true. To demand
	sacrifice of yourself is to demand a sacrifice of God, and He knows
	nothing of sacrifice. Who could ask of Perfection that He be
	imperfect?
</p>

<p>
	Who, then, decides what each brother needs? Surely not
	you, who do not yet recognise who he is who asks. There is
	Something in him that will tell you, if you listen. And that is the
	answer; listen. Do not demand, do not decide, do not sacrifice.
	Listen. What you hear is true. Would God send His Son to you and
	not be sure you recognise his needs? Think what God is telling you;
	He needs your voice to speak for Him. Could anything be holier?
	Or a greater gift to you? Would you rather choose who would be
	god, or hear the Voice of Him Who is God in you?
</p>

<p>
	Your patients need not be physically present for you to serve
	them in the Name of God. This may be hard to remember, but God
	will not have His gifts to you limited to the few you actually see.
	You can see others as well, for seeing is not limited to the bodyʹs
	eyes. Some do not need your physical presence. They need you as
	much, and perhaps even more, at the instant they are sent. You will
	recognise them in whatever way can be most helpful to both of you.
	It does not matter how they come. They will be sent in whatever
	form is most helpful; a name, a thought, a picture, an idea, or
	perhaps just a feeling of reaching out to someone somewhere. The
	joining is in the hands of the Holy Spirit. It cannot fail to be
	accomplished.
</p>

<p>
	A holy therapist, an advanced Teacher of God, never forgets
	one thing; he did not make the curriculum of salvation, nor did he
	establish his part in it. He understands that his part is necessary to
	the whole, and that through it he will recognise the whole when his
	part is complete. Meanwhile he must learn, and his patients are the
	means sent to him for his learning. What could he be but grateful
	for them and to them? They come bearing God. Would he refuse
	this Gift for a pebble, or would he close the door on the saviour of the
	world to let in a ghost? Let him not betray the Son of God. Who
	calls on him is far beyond his understanding. Yet would he not
	rejoice that he can answer, when only thus will he be able to hear
	the call and understand that it is his?
</p>

<h2 id="b">B. Is Psychotherapy a Profession?</h2>

<p>
	Strictly speaking the answer is no. How could a separate
	profession be one in which everyone is engaged? And how could
	any limits be laid on an interaction in which everyone is both
	patient and therapist in every relationship into which he enters?
	Yet practically speaking, it can still be said that there are those who
	devote themselves primarily to healing of one sort or another as
	their chief function. And it is to them that a large number of others
	turn for help. That, in effect, is the practice of therapy. These are
	therefore ‘officially’ helpers. They are devoted to certain kinds of
	needs in their professional activities, although they may be far more
	able teachers outside of them. These people need no special rules, of
	course, but they may be called upon to use special applications of
	the general principles of healing.
</p>

<p>
	First, the professional therapist is in an excellent position to
	demonstrate that there is no order of difficulty in healing. For this,
	however, he needs special training, because the curriculum by
	which he became a therapist probably taught him little or nothing
	about the real principles of healing. In fact, it probably tried to
	teach him how to make healing impossible. Most of the worldʹs
	training follows a curriculum in judgement, with the aim of making
	the therapist a judge.
</p>

<p>
	Even this the Holy Spirit can use, and will use, given the
	slightest invitation. The unhealed healer may be arrogant, selfish,
	unconcerned, and actually dishonest. He may be disinterested and
	unconcerned with healing as his major goal. Yet something
	happened to him, however slight it may have been, when he chose
	to be a healer, however misguided the direction he may have
	chosen. That ‘something’ is enough. Sooner or later that something
	will rise in awareness and grow; a patient will touch his heart, and
	the therapist will silently ask him for help. He has himself found a
	therapist. He has asked the Holy Spirit to enter the relationship and
	heal it. He has accepted the Atonement for himself.
</p>

<p>
	God is said to have looked on all He created and pronounced
	it good. No, He declared it perfect, and so it was. And since His
	creations do not change and last forever, so it is now. Yet neither a
	perfect therapist nor a perfect patient can possibly exist. Both must
	have denied their perfection, for their very need for each other
	implies a sense of lack. A one‐to‐one relationship is not one
	Relationship. Yet it is the means of return; the way God chose for
	the return of His Son. In that strange dream a strange correction
	must enter, for only that is the call to awake. And what else should
	therapy be? Awake and be glad, for all your sins have been
	forgiven you. This is the only message that any two should ever
	give each other.
</p>

<p>
	Something good must come from every meeting of patient
	and therapist. And that good is saved for both, against the day
	when they can recognise that only that was real in their relationship.
	At that moment it is returned to them, blessed by the Holy Spirit as
	a gift from their Creator as a sign of His Love. For the therapeutic
	relationship must become like the relationship of the Father and the
	Son. There is no other, for there is nothing else. The therapists of
	this world do not expect this outcome, and many of their patients
	would not be able to accept help from them if they did. Yet no
	therapist really sets the goal for the relationships of which he is a
	part. His understanding begins with recognising this, and then goes
	on from there.
</p>

<p>
	It is in the instant that the therapist forgets to judge the
	patient that healing occurs. In some relationships this point is never
	reached, although both patient and therapist may arrive at
	different dreams in the process. Yet it will not be the same dream
	for both of them, and so it is not the dream of forgiveness in which
	both will someday wake. The good is saved; indeed is cherished.
	But only little time is saved and the new dreams will lose their
	temporary appeal and turn to dreams of fear, which is the content of
	all dreams. Yet no patient can accept more than he is ready to
	receive, and no therapist can offer more than he believes he has.
	And so there is a place for all relationships in this world, and they
	will bring as much good as each can accept and use.
</p>

<p>
	Yet it is when judgement ceases that healing occurs, because
	only then it can be understood that there is no order of difficulty in
	healing. This is a necessary understanding for the healed healer.
	He has learned that it is no harder to wake a brother from one
	dream than from another. No professional therapist can hold this
	understanding consistently in his mind, offering it to all who come
	to him. There are some in this world who have come very close, but
	they have not accepted the gift entirely in order to stay and let their
	understanding remain on earth until the closing of time. They could
	hardly be called professional therapists. They are the Saints of God.
	They are the Saviours of the world. Their image remains, because
	they have chosen that it be so. They take the place of other images,
	and help with kindly dreams.
</p>

<p>
	Once the professional therapist has realised that minds are
	joined, he can also recognise that order of difficulty in healing is
	meaningless. Yet well before he reaches this in time he can go
	toward it. Many holy instants can be his along the way. A goal
	marks the end of a journey, not the beginning, and as each goal is
	reached another can be dimly seen ahead. Most professional
	therapists are still at the very start of the beginning stage of the first
	journey. Even those who have begun to understand what they must
	do may still oppose the setting‐out. Yet all the laws of healing can
	be theirs in just an instant. The journey is not long except in dreams.
</p>

<p>
	The professional therapist has one advantage that can save
	enormous time if it is properly used. He has chosen a road on
	which there is great temptation to misuse his role. This enables him
	to pass by many obstacles to peace quite quickly, if he escapes the
	temptation to assume a function that has not been given him. To
	understand there is no order of difficulty in healing, he must also
	recognise the equality of himself and the patient. There is no
	halfway point in this. Either they are equal or not. The attempts of
	therapists to compromise in this respect are strange indeed. Some
	utilise the relationship merely to collect bodies to worship at their
	shrine, and this they regard as healing. Many patients, too,
	consider this strange procedure as salvation. Yet at each meeting
	there is One Who says, ʺMy brother, choose againʺ.
</p>

<p>
	Do not forget that any form of specialness must be
	defended, and will be. The defenceless therapist has the strength of
	God with him, but the defensive therapist has lost sight of the
	Source of his salvation. He does not see and he does not hear. How,
	then, can he teach? Because it is the Will of God that he take his
	place in the plan for salvation. Because it is the Will of God that his
	patients be helped to join with him there. Because his inability to
	see and hear does not limit the Holy Spirit in any way. Except in
	time. In time there can be a great lag between the offering and the
	acceptance of healing. This is the veil across the Face of Christ. Yet
	it can be but an illusion, because time does not exist and the Will of
	God has always been exactly as it is.
</p>

<h2 id="c">C. The Question of Payment</h2>

<p>
	Noöne can pay for therapy, for healing is of God and He
	asks for nothing. It is, however, part of His plan that everything in
	this world be used by the Holy Spirit to help in carrying out the
	plan. Even an advanced therapist has some earthly needs while he
	is here. Should he need money it will be given him, not in payment,
	but to help him better serve the plan. Money is not evil. It is
	nothing. But noöne here can live with no illusions, for he must yet
	strive to have the last illusion be accepted by everyone everywhere.
	He has a mighty part in this one purpose, for which he came. He
	stays here but for this. And while he stays he will be given what he
	needs to stay.
</p>

<p>
	Only an unhealed healer could try to heal for money, and
	he will not succeed to the extent to which he values it. Nor will he
	find his healing in the process. There will be those of whom the
	Holy Spirit asks some payment for His purpose. There will be those
	from whom He does not ask. It should not be the therapist who
	makes these decisions. There is a difference between payment and
	cost. To give money where Godʹs plan allots it has no cost. To
	withhold it from where it rightfully belongs has enormous cost. The
	therapist who would do this loses the name of healer, for he could
	never understand what healing is. He cannot give it, and so he does
	not have it.
</p>

<p>
	The therapists of this world are indeed useless to the worldʹs
	salvation. They make demands, and so they cannot give. Patients
	can pay only for the exchange of illusions. This, indeed, must
	demand payment, and the cost is great. A ‘bought’ relationship
	cannot offer the only gift whereby all healing is accomplished.
	Forgiveness, the Holy Spiritʹs only dream, must have no cost. For if
	it does, it merely crucifies Godʹs Son again. Can this be how he is
	forgiven? Can this be how the dream of sin will end?
</p>

<p>
	The ‘right to live’ is something noöne need fight for. It is
	promised him, and guaranteed by God. Therefore it is a right the
	therapist and patient share alike. If their relationship is to be
	holy, whatever one needs is given by the other; whatever one lacks
	the other supplies. Hereïn is the relationship made holy, for hereïn
	both are healed. The therapist repays the patient in gratitude, as
	does the patient repay him. There is no cost to either. But thanks
	are due to both, for the release from long imprisonment and doubt.
	Who would not be grateful for such a gift? Yet who could possibly
	imagine that it could be bought?
</p>

<p>
	It has well been said that to him who has shall be given.
	Because he has, he can give. And because he gives, he shall be
	given. This is the law of God, and not of the world. So it is with
	Godʹs healers. They give because they have heard His Word and understood
	it. All that they need will thus be given them. But they will lose this
	understanding unless they remember that all they have comes only
	from God. If they believe they need anything from a brother, they
	will recognise him as a brother no longer. And if they do this, a
	light goes out even in Heaven. Where Godʹs Son turns against
	himself, he can look only upon darkness. He has himself denied the
	light, and cannot see.
</p>

<p>
	One rule should always be observed: Noöne should be
	turned away because he cannot pay. Noöne is sent by accident to
	anyone. Relationships are always purposeful. Whatever their
	purpose may have been before the Holy Spirit entered them, they
	are always His potential temple; the resting place of Christ and
	home of God Himself. Whoëver comes has been sent. Perhaps he
	was sent to give his brother the money he needed. Both will be
	blessed thereby. Perhaps he was sent to teach the therapist how
	much he needs forgiveness, and how valueless is money in
	comparison. Again will both be blessed. Only in terms of cost
	could one have more. In sharing, everyone must gain a blessing
	without cost.
</p>

<p>
	This view of payment may well seem impractical, and in the
	eyes of the world it would be so. Yet not one worldly thought is
	really practical. How much is gained by striving for illusions? How
	much is lost by throwing God away? And is it possible to do so?
	Surely it is impractical to strive for nothing, and to attempt to do
	what is impossible. Then stop a while, long enough to think of this:
	You have perhaps been seeking for salvation without
	recognising where to look. Whoëver asks your help can show you
	where. What greater gift than this could you be given? What
	greater gift is there that you would give?
</p>

<p>
	Physician, healer, therapist, teacher, heal yourself. Many will
	come to you carrying the gift of healing, if you so elect. The Holy
	Spirit never refuses an invitation to enter and abide with you. He
	will give you endless opportunities to open the door to your
	salvation, for such is His function. He will also tell you exactly what
	your function is in every circumstance and at all times. Whoëver He
	sends you will reach you, holding out his hand to his Friend. Let
	the Christ in you bid him welcome, for that same Christ is in him as
	well. Deny him entrance, and you have denied the Christ in you.
	Remember the sorrowful story of the world, and the glad tidings
	of salvation. Remember the plan of God for the restoration of joy
	and peace. And do not forget how very simple are the ways of God:
</p>

<blockquote>
	You were lost in the darkness of the world until you asked for light.<br />
	And then God sent His Son to give it to you.
</blockquote>

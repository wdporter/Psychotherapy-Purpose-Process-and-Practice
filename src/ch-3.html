<h2>A. Introduction</h2>


<p>
	Psychotherapy is a process that changes the view of the self. 
	At best this ‘new’ self is a more beneficent self‐concept, but psychotherapy can hardly be expected to establish reality. 
	That is not its function. 
	If it can make way for reality, it has achieved its ultimate success. 
	Its whole function, in the end, is to help the patient deal with one fundamental error; the belief that anger brings him something he really wants, and that by justifying attack he is protecting himself. 
	To whatever extent he comes to realise that this is mistaken, to that extent is he truly saved.
</p>

<p>
	Patients do not enter the therapeutic relationship with this goal in mind. 
	On the contrary, such concepts mean little to them, or they would not need help. 
	Their aim is to be able to retain their self‐concept exactly as it is, but without the suffering that it entails.
	Their whole equilibrium rests on the insane belief that this is possible. 
	And because to the sane mind it is so clearly impossible, what they seek is magic. 
	In illusions the impossible is easily accomplished, but only at the cost of making illusions true. 
	The patient has already paid this price. 
	Now he wants a ‘better’ illusion.
</p>


<p>
	At the beginning, then, the patientʹs goal and the therapistʹs are at variance. 
	The therapist as well as the patient may cherish false self‐concepts, but their respective perceptions of ‘improvement’ still must differ. 
	The patient hopes to learn how to get the changes he wants without changing his self‐concept to any
	significant extent. 
	He hopes, in fact, to stabilise it sufficiently to include within it the magical powers he seeks in psychotherapy. 
	He wants to make the vulnerable invulnerable and the finite limitless. 
	The self he sees is his god, and he seeks only to serve it better.
</p>

<p>
	Regardless of how advanced the therapist himself may be, he must want to change the patientʹs self‐concept in some way that he believes is real. 
	The task of therapy is one of reconciling these differences. 
	Hopefully, both will learn to give up their original goals, for it is only in relationships that salvation can be found. 
	At the beginning, it is inevitable that patients and therapists alike accept unrealistic goals not completely free of magical overtones. 
	They are finally given up in the minds of both.
</p>

<h2 id="b">B. The Limits on Psychotherapy</h2>

<p>
	Yet the ideal outcome is rarely achieved. 
	But psychotherapy begins with the realisation that healing is of the mind, and in psychotherapy those have come together who believe this. 
	It may be they will not get much further, for noöne learns beyond his own readiness. 
	Yet levels of readiness change, and when therapist or patient has reached the next one, there will be a relationship held out to them that meets the changing need. 
	Perhaps they will come together again and advance in the same relationship, making it holier. 
	Or perhaps each of them will enter into another commitment. 
	Be assured of this; each will progress. 
	Retrogression is temporary. 
	The overall direction is one of progress toward the truth.
</p>

<p>
	Psychotherapy itself cannot be creative. 
	This is one of the errors which the ego fosters; that it is capable of true change, and therefore of true creativity. 
	When we speak of ‘the saving illusion’ or ‘the final dream’, this is not what we mean, but here is the egoʹs last defence. 
	‘Resistance’ is its way of looking at things; its interpretation of ‘progress’ and ‘growth’. 
	These interpretations will be wrong of necessity, because they are delusional. 
	The ‘changes’ the ego seeks to make are not really changes. 
	They are but deeper shadows, or perhaps different cloud patterns. 
	Yet what is made of nothingness cannot be called new or different. 
	Illusions are illusions; truth is truth.
</p>

<p>
	Resistance as defined here can be characteristic of a therapist as well as of a patient.
	Either way, it sets a limit on psychotherapy because it restricts its aims.
	Nor can the Holy Spirit fight against the intrusions of the ego on the therapeutic process.
	But He will wait, and His patience is infinite.
	His goal is wholly undivided always.
	Whatever resolutions patient and therapist reach in connection with their own divergent goals, they cannot become completely reconciled as one until they join with His.
	Only then is all conflict over, for only then can there be certainty.
</p>

<p>
	Ideally, psychotherapy is a series of holy encounters in which brothers meet to bless each other and to receive the peace of God.
	And this will one day come to pass for every ‘patient’ on the face of this earth, for who except a patient could possibly have come here?
	The therapist is only a somewhat more specialised Teacher of God.
	He learns through teaching, and the more advanced he is the more he teaches and the more he learns.
	But whatever stage he is in, there are patients who need him just that way.
	They cannot take more than he can give for now.
	Yet they both will find sanity at last.
</p>

<h2 id="c">C. The Place of Religion in Psychotherapy</h2>

<p>
	To be a Teacher of God, it is not necessary to be religious or even to believe in God to any recognisable extent.
	It is necessary, however, to teach forgiveness rather than condemnation.
	Even in this, complete consistency is not required, for one who has achieved that point can teach salvation completely, within an instant and without a word.
	Yet he who has learned all things does not need a teacher, and the healed have no need for a therapist.
	Relationships are still the Temple of the Holy Spirit, and they will be made perfect in time and restored to Eternity.
</p>

<p>
	Formal religion has no place in psychotherapy, but it also has no real place in religion.
	In this world, there is an astonishing tendency to join contradictory words into one term without perceiving the contradiction at all.
	The attempt to formalise religion is so obviously an ego attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable that it hardly requires elaboration here.
	Religion is experience; psychotherapy is experience.
	At the highest levels they become one.
	Neither is truth itself, but both can lead to truth.
	What can be necessary to find truth, which remains perfectly obvious, but to remove the seeming obstacles to true awareness?
</p>

<p>
	Noöne who learns to forgive can fail to remember God.
	Forgiveness, then, is all that need be taught, because it is all that need be learned.
	All blocks to the remembrance of God are forms of unforgiveness, and nothing else.
	This is never apparent to the patient, and only rarely so to the therapist.
	The world has marshalled all its forces against this one awareness, for in it lies the ending of the world and all it stands for.
</p>

<p>
	Yet it is not the awareness of God that constitutes a reasonable goal for psychotherapy.
	This will come when psychotherapy is complete, for where there is forgiveness truth must come.
	It would be unfair indeed if belief in God were necessary to psychotherapeutic success.
	Nor is belief in God a really meaningful concept, for God can be but known.
	Belief implies that unbelief is possible, but knowledge of God has no true opposite.
	Not to know God is to have no knowledge, and it is to this that all unforgiveness leads.
	And without knowledge one can have only belief.
</p>

<p>
	Different teaching aids appeal to different people. Some
	forms of religion have nothing to do with God, and some forms of
	psychotherapy have nothing to do with healing. Yet if pupil and
	teacher join in sharing one goal, God will enter into their
	relationship because He has been invited to come in. In the same
	way, a union of purpose between patient and therapist restores the
	place of God to ascendance, first through Christʹs vision and then
	through the memory of God Himself. The process of psychotherapy
	is the return to sanity. Teacher and pupil, therapist and patient, are
	all insane or they would not be here. Together they can find a
	pathway out, for no‐one will find sanity alone.
</p>

<p>
	If healing is an invitation to God to enter into His Kingdom,
	what difference does it make how the invitation is written? Does
	the paper matter, or the ink, or the pen? Or is it he who writes that
	gives the invitation? God comes to those who would restore His
	world, for they have found the way to call to Him. If any two are
	joined, He must be there. It does not matter what their purpose is,
	but they must share it wholly to succeed. It is impossible to share a
	goal not blessed by Christ, for what is unseen through His eyes is
	too fragmented to be meaningful.
</p>

<p>
	As true religion heals, so must true psychotherapy be
	religious. But both have many forms, because no true teacher uses
	one approach to every pupil. On the contrary, he listens patiently to
	each one, and lets him formulate his own curriculum; not the
	curriculumʹs goal, but how he can best reach the aim it sets for him.
	Perhaps the teacher does not think of God as part of teaching.
	Perhaps the psychotherapist does not understand that healing
	comes from God. They can succeed where many who believe they
	have found God will fail.
</p>

<p>
	What must the teacher do to ensure learning? What must the
	therapist do to bring healing about? Only one thing; the same
	requirement salvation asks of everyone. Each one must share one
	goal with someone else, and in so doing, lose all sense of separate
	interests. Only by doing this is it possible to transcend the narrow
	boundaries the ego would impose upon the self. Only by doing this
	can teacher and pupil, therapist and patient, you and I, accept
	Atonement and learn to give it as it was received.
</p>

<p>
	Communion is impossible alone. Noöne who stands apart
	can receive Christʹs vision. It is held out to him, but he cannot hold
	out his hand to receive it. Let him be still and recognise his
	brotherʹs need is his own. And let him then meet his brotherʹs
	need as his and see that they are met as one, for such they are. What
	is religion but an aid in helping him to see that this is so? And what
	is psychotherapy except a help in just this same direction? It is the
	goal that makes these processes the same, for they are one in
	purpose and must thus be one in means.
</p>

<h2 id="d">D. The Role of the Psychotherapist</h2>

<p>
	The psychotherapist is a leader in the sense that he walks
	slightly ahead of the patient, and helps him to avoid a few of the
	pitfalls along the road by seeing them first. Ideally, he is also a
	follower, for One should walk ahead of him to give him light to see.
	Without this One, both will merely stumble blindly on to nowhere.
	It is, however, impossible that this One be wholly absent if the goal
	is healing. He may, however, not be recognised. And so the little
	light that can be then accepted is all there is to light the way to truth.
</p>

<p>
	Healing is limited by the limitations of the psychotherapist,
	as it is limited by those of the patient. The aim of the process,
	therefore, is to transcend these limits. Neither can do this alone, but
	when they join, the potentiality for transcending all limitations has
	been given them. Now the extent of their success depends on how
	much of this potentiality they are willing to use. The willingness
	may come from either one at the beginning, and as the other shares
	it, it will grow. Progress becomes a matter of decision; it can reach
	almost to Heaven or go no further than a step or two from hell.
</p>

<p>
	It is quite possible for psychotherapy to seem to fail. It is
	even possible for the result to look like retrogression. But in the end
	there must be some success. One asks for help; another hears and
	tries to answer in the form of help. This is the formula for salvation,
	and must heal. Divided goals alone can interfere with perfect
	healing. One wholly egoless therapist could heal the world without
	a word, merely by being there. Noöne need see him or talk to him
	or even know of his existence. His simple Presence is enough to
	heal.
</p>

<p>
	The ideal therapist is one with Christ. But healing is a
	process, not a fact. The therapist cannot progress without the
	patient, and the patient cannot be ready to receive the Christ or he
	could not be sick. In a sense, the egoless psychotherapist is an
	abstraction that stands at the end of the process of healing, too
	advanced to believe in sickness and too near to God to keep his feet
	on earth. Now he can help through those in need of help, for thus
	he carries out the plan established for salvation. The
	psychotherapist becomes his patient, working through other
	patients to express his thoughts as he receives them from the Mind
	of Christ.
</p>

<h2 id="e">E. The Process of Illness</h2>

<p>
	As all therapy is psychotherapy, so all illness is mental
	illness. It is a judgement on the Son of God, and judgement is a
	mental activity. Judgment is a decision, made again and again,
	against creation and its Creator. It is a decision to perceive the
	universe as you would have created it. It is a decision that truth can
	lie and must be lies. What, then, can illness be except an expression
	of sorrow and of guilt? And who could weep but for his innocence?
</p>

<p>
	Once Godʹs Son is seen as guilty, illness becomes inevitable.
	It has been asked for and will be received. And all who ask for
	illness have now condemned themselves to seek for remedies that
	cannot help, because their faith is in the illness and not in salvation.
	There can be nothing that a change of mind cannot effect, for all
	external things are only shadows of a decision already made.
	Change the decision, and how can its shadow be unchanged?
	Illness can be but guiltʹs shadow, grotesque and ugly since it mimics
	deformity. If a deformity is seen as real, what could its shadow be
	except deformed?
</p>

<p>
	The descent into hell follows step by step in an inevitable
	course, once the decision that guilt is real has been made. Sickness
	and death and misery now stalk the earth in unrelenting waves,
	sometimes together and sometimes in grim succession. Yet all these
	things, however real they seem, are but illusions. Who could have
	faith in them once this is realised? And who could not have faith in
	them until he realises this? Healing is therapy or correction, and we
	have said already and will say again, all therapy is psychotherapy.
	To heal the sick is but to bring this realisation to them.
</p>

<p>
	The word ‘cure’ has come into disrepute among the more
	‘respectable’ therapists of the world, and justly so. For not one of
	them can cure, and not one of them understands healing. At
	worst, they but make the body real in their own minds, and having
	done so, seek for magic by which to heal the ills with which their
	minds endow it. How could such a process cure? It is
	ridiculous from start to finish. Yet having started, it must finish
	thus. It is as if God were the devil and must be found in evil. How
	could love be there? And how could sickness cure? Are not these
	both one question?
</p>

<p>
	At best, and the word is perhaps questionable here, the
	‘healers’ of the world may recognise the mind as the source of
	illness. But their error lies in the belief that it can cure itself. This
	has some merit in a world where ‘degrees of error’ is a meaningful
	concept. Yet must their cures remain temporary, or another illness
	rise instead, for death has not been overcome until the meaning of
	love is understood. And who can understand this without the Word
	of God, given by Him to the Holy Spirit as His gift to you?
</p>

<p>
	Illness of any kind may be defined as the result of a view of
	the self as weak, vulnerable, evil and endangered, and thus in need
	of constant defence. Yet if such were really the self, defence would
	be impossible. Therefore, the defences sought for must be magical.
	They must overcome all limits perceived in the self, at the same time
	making a new self‐concept into which they cannot return. In a
	word, error is accepted as real and dealt with by illusions. Truth
	being brought to illusions, reality now becomes a threat and is
	perceived as evil. Love becomes feared because reality is love. Thus
	is the circle closed against the ‘inroads’ of salvation.
</p>

<p>
	Illness is therefore a mistake and needs correction. And as
	we have already emphasised before, correction cannot be achieved
	by first establishing the ‘rightness’ of the mistake and then
	overlooking it. If illness is real it cannot be overlooked in truth, for
	to overlook reality is insanity. Yet that is magicʹs purpose; to make
	illusions true through false perception. This cannot heal, for it
	opposes truth. Perhaps an illusion of health is substituted for a little
	while, but not for long. Fear cannot long be hidden by illusions, for
	it is part of them. It will escape and take another form, being the
	source of all illusions.
</p>

<p>
	Sickness is insanity because all sickness is mental illness, and
	in it there are no degrees. One of the illusions by which sickness is
	perceived as real is the belief that illness varies in intensity; that the
	degree of threat differs according to the form it takes. Hereïn lies
	the basis of all errors, for all of them are but attempts to
	compromise by seeing just a little bit of hell. This is a mockery so
	alien to God that it must be forever inconceivable. But the insane
	believe it because they are insane.
</p>

<p>
	A madman will defend his own illusions because in them he
	sees his own salvation. Thus, he will attack the one who tries to
	save him from them, believing that he is attacking him. This curious
	circle of attack–defence is one of the most difficult problems with
	which the psychotherapist must deal. In fact, this is his central task;
	the core of psychotherapy. The therapist is seen as one who is
	attacking the patientʹs most cherished possession; his picture of
	himself. And since this picture has become the patientʹs security as
	he perceives it, the therapist cannot but be seen as a real source of
	danger, to be attacked and even killed.
</p>

<p>
	The psychotherapist, then, has a tremendous responsibility.
	He must meet attack without attack, and therefore without defence.
	It is his task to demonstrate that defences are not necessary, and that
	defencelessness is strength. This must be his teaching, if his lesson
	is to be that sanity is safe. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that
	the insane believe that sanity is threat. This is the corollary of the
	‘original sin’; the belief that guilt is real and fully justified. It is
	therefore the psychotherapist’s function to teach that guilt, being
	unreal, cannot be justified. But neither is it safe. And thus it must
	remain unwanted as well as unreal.
</p>

<p>
	Salvation’s single doctrine is the goal of all therapy. Relieve
	the mind of the insane burden of guilt it carries so wearily, and
	healing is accomplished. The body is not cured. It is merely
	recognised as what it is. Seen rightly, its purpose can be
	understood. What is the need for sickness then? Given this single
	shift, all else will follow. There is no need for complicated change.
	There is no need for long analyses and wearying discussions and
	pursuits. The truth is simple, being one for all.
</p>

<h2 id="f">F. The Process of Healing</h2>

<p>
	While truth is simple, it must still be taught to those who
	have already lost their way in endless mazes of complexity. This is
	the great illusion. In its wake comes the inevitable belief that, to be
	safe, one must control the unknown. This strange belief relies on
	certain steps which never reach to consciousness. First, it is ushered
	in by the belief that there are forces to be overcome to be alive at all.
	And next, it seems as if these forces can be held at bay only by an
	inflated sense of self that holds in darkness what is truly felt, and
	seeks to raise illusions to the light.
</p>

<p>
	Let us remember that the ones who come to us for help are
	bitterly afraid. What they believe will help can only harm; what
	they believe will harm alone can help. Progress becomes impossible
	until the patient is persuaded to reverse his twisted way of looking
	at the world; his twisted way of looking at himself. The truth is
	simple. Yet it must be taught to those who think it will endanger
	them. It must be taught to those who will attack because they feel
	endangered, and to those who need the lesson of defencelessness
	above all else, to show them what is strength.
</p>

<p>
	If this world were ideal, there could perhaps be ideal therapy.
	And yet it would be useless in an ideal state. We speak of ideal
	teaching in a world in which the perfect teacher could not long
	remain; the perfect psychotherapist is but a glimmer of a thought
	not yet conceived. But still we speak of what can yet be done in
	helping the insane within the bounds of the attainable. While they
	are sick, they can and must be helped. No more than that is asked
	of psychotherapy; no less than all he has to give is worthy of the
	therapist. For God Himself holds out his brother as his Saviour
	from the world.
</p>

<p>
	Healing is holy. Nothing in the world is holier than helping
	one who asks for help. And two come very close to God in this
	attempt, however limited, however lacking in sincerity. Where two
	have joined for healing, God is there. And He has guaranteed that
	He will hear and answer them in truth. They can be sure that
	healing is a process He directs, because it is according to His Will.
	We have His Word to guide us, as we try to help our brothers. Let
	us not forget that we are helpless of ourselves, and lean upon a
	strength beyond our little scope for what to teach as well as what to
	learn.
</p>

<p>
	A brother seeking aid can bring us gifts beyond the heights
	perceived in any dream. He offers us salvation, for he comes to us
	as Christ and Saviour. What he asks is asked by God through him.
	And what we do for him becomes the gift we give to God. The
	sacred calling of Godʹs holy Son for help in his perceived distress
	can be but answered by his Father. Yet He needs a voice through
	which to speak His holy Word; a hand to reach His Son and touch
	his heart. In such a process, who could not be healed? This holy
	interaction is the plan of God Himself, by which His Son is saved.
</p>

<p>
	For two have joined. And now Godʹs promises are kept by
	Him. The limits laid on both the patient and the therapist will count
	as nothing, for the healing has begun. What man must start his
	Father will complete. For He has never asked for more than just the
	smallest willingness, the least advance, the tiniest of whispers of His
	Name. To ask for help, whatever form it takes, is but to call on Him.
	And He will send His Answer through the therapist who best can
	serve His Son in all his present needs. Perhaps the answer does not
	seem to be a gift from Heaven. It may even seem to be a worsening
	and not a help. Yet let the outcome not be judged by us.
</p>

<p>
	Somewhere all gifts of God must be received. In time no
	effort can be made in vain. It is not our perfection that is asked in
	our attempts to heal. We are deceived already, if we think there is a
	need of healing. And the truth will come to us only through one
	who seems to share our dream of sickness. Let us help him to
	forgive himself for all the trespasses with which he would condemn
	himself without a cause. His healing is our own. And as we see
	the sinlessness in him come shining through the veil of guilt that
	shrouds the Son of God, we will behold in him the Face of Christ,
	and understand that it is but our own.
</p>

<p>
	Let us stand silently before Godʹs Will, and do what It has
	chosen that we do. There is one way alone by which we come to
	where all dreams began. And it is there that we will lay them down,
	to come away in peace forever. Hear a brother call for help and
	answer him. It will be God to Whom you answer, for you called on
	Him. There is no other way to hear His Voice. There is no other
	way to seek His Son. There is no other way to find your Self.
	Holy is healing, for the Son of God returns to Heaven through its
	kind embrace. For healing tells him, in the Voice of God, that all
	his sins have been forgiven him.
</p>

<h2 id="g">G. The Definition of Healing</h2>

<p>
	The process of psychotherapy, then, can be defined simply as
	forgiveness, for no healing can be anything else. The unforgiving
	are sick, believing they are unforgiven. The hanging‐on to guilt, its
	hugging‐close and sheltering, its loving protection and alert defence,
	— all this is but the grim refusal to forgive. ʺGod may not enter
	hereʺ the sick repeat, over and over, while they mourn their loss and
	yet rejoice in it. Healing occurs as a patient begins to hear the dirge
	he sings, and questions its validity. Until he hears it, he cannot
	understand that it is he who sings it to himself. To hear it is the first
	step in recovery. To question it must then become his choice.
</p>

<p>
	There is a tendency, and it is very strong, to hear this song of
	death an instant, and then dismiss it uncorrected. These fleeting
	awarenesses represent the many opportunities given us literally ‘to
	change our tune’. The sound of healing can be heard instead. But
	first the willingness to question the ‘truth’ of the song of
	condemnation must arise. The strange distortions woven
	inextricably into the self‐concept, itself but a ‘pseudo‐creation’,
	make this ugly sound seem truly beautiful. ‘The rhythm of the
	universe’, ‘the herald angelʹs song’, all these and more are heard
	instead of loud discordant shrieks.
</p>

<p>
	The ear translates; it does not hear. The eye reproduces; it
	does not see. Their task is to make agreeable whatever is called on,
	however disagreeable it may be. They answer the decisions of the
	mind, reproducing its desires and translating them into acceptable
	and pleasant forms. Sometimes the thought behind the form breaks
	through, but only very briefly, and the mind grows fearful and
	begins to doubt its sanity. Yet it will not permit its slaves to change
	the forms they look upon; the sounds they hear. These are its
	‘remedies’; its ‘safeguards’ from insanity.
</p>

<p>
	These testimonies which the senses bring have but one
	purpose; to justify attack and thus keep unforgiveness unrecognised
	for what it is. Seen undisguised it is intolerable. Without protection
	it could not endure. Here is all sickness cherished, but without the
	recognition that this is so. For when an unforgiveness is not
	recognised, the form it takes seems to be something else. And now
	it is the ‘something else’ that seems to terrify. But it is not the
	‘something else’ that can be healed. It is not sick, and needs no
	remedy. To concentrate your healing efforts here is but futility.
	Who can cure what cannot be sick and make it well?
</p>

<p>
	Sickness takes many forms, and so does unforgiveness. The
	forms of one but reproduce the forms of the other, for they are the
	same illusion. So closely is one translated into the other, that a
	careful study of the form a sickness takes will point quite clearly to
	the form of unforgiveness that it represents. Yet seeing this will not
	effect a cure. That is achieved by only one recognition; that only
	forgiveness heals an unforgiveness, and only an unforgiveness can
	possibly give rise to sickness of any kind.
</p>

<p>
	This realisation is the final goal of psychotherapy. How is it
	reached? The therapist sees in the patient all that he has not
	forgiven in himself, and is thus given another chance to look at it,
	open it to reëvaluation and forgive it. When this occurs, he sees his
	sins as gone into a past that is no longer here. Until he does this, he
	must think of evil as besetting him here and now. The patient is his
	screen for the projection of his sins, enabling him to let them go. Let
	him retain one spot of sin in what he looks upon, and his release is
	partial and will not be sure.
</p>

<p>
	Noöne is healed alone. This is the joyous song salvation
	sings to all who hear its Voice. This statement cannot be too often
	remembered by all who see themselves as therapists. Their patients
	can but be seen as the bringers of forgiveness, for it is they who
	come to demonstrate their sinlessness to eyes that still believe that
	sin is there to look upon. Yet will the proof of sinlessness, seen in
	the patient and accepted in the therapist, offer the mind of both a
	covenant in which they meet and join and are as one.
</p>

<h2 id="h">H. The Ideal Patient–Therapist Relationship</h2>

<p>
	Who, then, is the therapist, and who is the patient? In the
	end, everyone is both. He who needs healing must heal.
	“Physician, heal yourself”. Who else is there to heal? And who else
	is in need of healing? Each patient who comes to a therapist offers
	him a chance to heal himself. He is therefore his therapist. And
	every therapist must learn to heal from each patient who comes to
	him. He thus becomes his patient. God does not know of separation.
	What He knows is only that He has one Son. His knowledge is
	reflected in the ideal patient–therapist relationship. God comes to
	him who calls, and in Him he recognises Himself.
</p>

<p>
	Think carefully, teacher and therapist, for whom you pray,
	and who is in need of healing. For therapy is prayer, and healing is
	its aim and its result. What is prayer except the joining of minds in
	a relationship which Christ can enter? This is His home, into which
	psychotherapy invites Him. What is symptom cure, when another
	is always there to choose? But once Christ enters in, what choice is
	there except to have Him stay? There is no need for more than this,
	for it is everything. Healing is here, and happiness and peace.
	These are the ‘symptoms’ of the ideal patient–therapist relationship,
	replacing those with which the patient came to ask for help.
</p>

<p>
	The process that takes place in this relationship is actually
	one in which the therapist in his heart tells the patient that all his
	sins have been forgiven him, along with his own. What could be the
	difference between healing and forgiveness? Only Christ forgives,
	knowing His sinlessness. His vision heals perception and sickness
	disappears. Nor will it return again, once its cause has been
	removed. This, however, needs the help of a very advanced
	therapist, capable of joining with the patient in a holy relationship in
	which all sense of separation finally is overcome.
</p>

<p>
	For this, one thing and one thing only is required: The
	therapist in no way confuses himself with God. All ‘unhealed
	healers’ make this fundamental confusion in one form or another,
	because they must regard themselves as self‐created rather than
	God‐created. This confusion is rarely if ever in awareness, or the
	unhealed healer would instantly become a Teacher of God,
	devoting his life to the function of true healing. Before he reached
	this point, he thought he was in charge of the therapeutic process
	and was therefore responsible for its outcome. His patientʹs
	failures thus became his own mistakes, and guilt became the
	cover, dark and strong, for what should be the Holiness of Christ.
	Guilt is inevitable in those who use their judgement in making their
	decisions. Guilt is impossible in those through whom the Holy
	Spirit speaks.
</p>

<p>
	The passing of guilt is the true aim of therapy and the
	obvious aim of forgiveness. In this their oneness can be clearly seen.
	Yet who could experience the end of guilt who feels responsible for
	his brother in the role of guide for him? Such a function
	presupposes a knowledge that noöne here can have; a certainty of
	past, present and future, and of all the effects that may occur in
	them. Only from this omniscient point of view would such a role be
	possible. Yet no perception is omniscient, nor is the tiny self of one
	alone against the universe able to assume he has such wisdom
	except in madness. That many therapists are mad is obvious. No
	unhealed healer can be wholly sane.
</p>

<p>
	Yet it is as insane not to accept a function God has given you
	as to invent one He has not. The advanced therapist in no way can
	ever doubt the power that is in him. Nor does he doubt its Source.
	He understands all power in earth and Heaven belongs to him
	because of who he is. And he is this because of his Creator, Whose
	Love is in him and Who cannot fail. Think what this means; he has
	the gifts of God Himself to give away. His patients are Godʹs saints,
	who call upon his sanctity to make it theirs. And as he gives it to
	them, they behold Christʹs shining face as it looks back at them.
</p>

<p>
	The insane, thinking they are God, are not afraid to offer
	weakness to the Son of God. But what they see in him because of
	this they fear indeed. The unhealed healer cannot but be fearful of
	his patients, and suspect them of the treachery he sees in him. He
	tries to heal, and thus at times he may. But he will not succeed
	except to some extent and for a little while. He does not see the
	Christ in him who calls. What answer can he give to one who
	seems to be a stranger; alien to the truth and poor in wisdom,
	without the god who must be given him? Behold your God in him,
	for what you see will be your Answer.
</p>

<p>
	Think what the joining of two brothers really means. And
	then forget the world and all its little triumphs and its dreams of
	death. The same are one, and nothing now can be remembered of
	the world of guilt. The room becomes a temple, and the street a
	stream of stardust brushing lightly past all sickly dreams. Healing
	is done, for what is perfect needs no healing, and what remains to be
	forgiven where there is no sin?
</p>

<p>
	Be thankful, therapist, that you can see such things as this, if
	you but understand your proper role. But if you fail in that, you
	have denied that God created you, and so you will not know you
	are His Son. Who is your brother now? What saint can come to
	take you home with him? You lost the way. And can you now
	expect to see in him an answer that you have refused to give? Heal
	and be healed. There is no other choice of pathways that can ever
	lead to peace. Oh let your patient in, for he has come to you from
	God. Is not his holiness enough to wake your memory of Him?
</p>

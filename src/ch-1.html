<p>
Psychotherapy is the only form of therapy there is. 
Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed. 
Only the mind is in need of healing. 
This does not appear to be the case, for the manifestations of this world seem real indeed. 
Psychotherapy is necessary so that an individual can begin to question his reality. 
Sometimes he is able to start to open his mind without formal help, but even then it is always some change in his perception of interpersonal relationships that enables him to do so. 
Sometimes he needs a more structured, extended relationship with an ‘official’ therapist. 
Either way, the task is the same; the patient must be helped to change his mind about the ‘reality’ of illusions.
